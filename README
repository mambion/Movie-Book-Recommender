## How to use
  This project is a book/ movie recommender. It uses a recommendation algorithm based on the users likes (genres/ authors/ actors) and gives
  the user a recommendation in the command line. 
- The code introduces the user to what is about to happen, prompts the user to answer a few questions, and responds with book recommendations within the command line.
- Documentation on how to use the program / how to interpret the output of the program.
  Running the code will prompt a command line conversation. All information will be there. Interpreting the program will be reading the 
  command line outputs.
An annotated bibliography of all sources you used to develop the program and how you used them.

1. Once you've cloned the repository, locate "recommender.py"
2. Then type "python3 recommender.py" into the terminal
3. Follow the steps presented by the code and it should display your movie/book recommendations.
4. MAKE SURE GENRES FOR MOVIES START WITH A CAPITAL LETTER TO AVOID ERRORS. 

## Features

- This code pulls information from a database of books and a database from movies. Using information from that database, it helps the user find a book or a movie they may be interested in by using certain characteristics such as length and genre. 

## Installation

- Clone the repository by copying the link and pasting it to VS code. You can also download "recommender.py" along with the suppporting database files. Make sure both database files are in the same folder as "recommender.py" to ensure that it runs properly.
